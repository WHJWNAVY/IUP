**IUP** is a multi-platform toolkit for building graphical user interfaces. It offers a  simple API in three   basic languages: C, Lua and LED. **IUP**'s purpose is to allow a program  source code to be compiled in different systems without any modification. Its main advantages are: 

- high performance, due to the fact that it uses native interface elements.
- fast learning by the user, due to the simplicity of its API.

This work was developed at Tecgraf/PUC-Rio by means of the partnership with PETROBRAS/CENPES.
